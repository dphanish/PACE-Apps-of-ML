    "    - questionable domains (\"google.asdqwkjf92.ohno\", \"definitely-not-stealing-your-info.org\"),\n",

    "    - You may have already done this for your school/work emails to sort by topic!\n",
    "3. We then execute the email rules to test their validity\n",
    "    - We need to identify correctness, including false positives (good emails mislabeled as spam) and false negatives (spam emails that were missed by our rules)\n",
    "4. We update our rules accordingly, and repeat until we're satisfied.\n",

    "    - The dataset may have defined characteristics (sender, message length, domain, etc.), or it may not, in which case we have to define our own.\n",
    "    - Additionally, we can always define additional fields from existing data through a process known as **feature engineering** (e.g., _x_ and _y_ coordinates might be better presented as polar coordinates for data centered around some location).\n",
    "2. We choose an algorithm that can consider the input characteristics and the categorization to determine which emails are spam and which are not.\n",
    "    - There are numerous existing algorithms (linear/logistic regression, neural networks, nearest neighbor, etc.) that can be modified, or a new algorithm can be defined (this is a very active research area after all!).\n",
    "3. We divide the dataset into training and test subsets, typically through some form of random selection.\n",
    "    - Different algorithms perform differently depending on the data, so we want to ascertain our model's efficacy before deploying it in the wild.\n",
    "    - Because of the underlying statistcs used in ML, it can often be helpful to explore resampling in an effort to assess the validity of our model.\n",
    "4. We tune our algorithm until we reach the desired level of accuracy, and then we deploy the model in the real world.\n",
    "    - Unlike the traditional method, machine learning has the ability to adapt to novel spam data - the model might need retraining, but we can in theory still use the same algorithm (this is what you're doing when you provide feedback on applications like Google Maps).\n",

Fortunately, framework such as TensorFlow and PyTorch significantly ease the transition from CPU to GPU, to the point where developing directly for GPU training is accessible. However, issues with scaling, either in terms of data or process distribution, can often manifest as one increases the scope of their project. Additionally, hardware-specific optimizations may be missed as code is migrated to new hardware, especially if outdated versions of computational libraries are used.\n",
